			Ain't no prohibition for this Manhattan melody â€“ shaken, not stirred in
			glamour's symphony.
		</h2>
		<p>
			In "Some Like It Hot," the Manhattan cocktail embodies the sophistication
			of the 1920s in this classic comedy. Made with whiskey, sweet vermouth,
			and bitters, the cocktail complements the glamorous setting and witty
			banter between characters. Marilyn Monroe's character, Sugar Kane, adds to
			the allure, embodying the charm and sophistication of the era.
